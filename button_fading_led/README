This is the first program (not actually the first, but the first I liked) I made for my Arduino.
When you press a button the ledPower increases. Then, when you release it, the LED will fade out.
There are two mistakes in this project: the first one is that you just can't abort the fading:
it's a for loop, controlled only by ledPower variable. The second one will happen if you press
the button for too much time: the LED will go to a logic zero and then increase again. I guess
it's kind of an overflow on voltage controller, but I really don't know. To avoid it, just set
a maximum ledPower, like 255.
